# ML-Intrusion-Detection-System
I did this project during my master degree at Concordia University. It was about training diffrent ML models:
- Logistic regresion
- SVM
- Random Forest
- LGBM
- Naive Bayse
in order to detect malcious traffic in the network. Specifically, Ml model that detects various type of attacks like DDoS, R2L, U2R, and Probe.
Moreover, many ML techniques have been applied like (feature scaling, feature selection, cross validation, ...).

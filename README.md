# ML-Intrusion-Detection-System
I did this project during my master study at Concordia University. It is about training diffrent ML models:
- Logistic regresion
- SVM
- Random Forest
- LGBM
- Naive Bayse
in order to detect malicious traffic in the network. Specifically, ML models that detects various type of attacks like DDoS, R2L, U2R, and Probe.

Moreover, many ML techniques have been applied like (feature scaling, feature selection, cross validation, ...).
